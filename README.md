I have a sports book and there are winners and losers every week. The sports book generates an excel sheet with the winners & their winnings, & losers & their losses.

Once a week we need to figure out what losers need to pay what winners for the previous week.

I want to use the presented excel sheet to figure out what losers need to pay the winners & how much they need to pay.
